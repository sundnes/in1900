# How to make slides

The slides are written in DocOnce format, see https://github.com/hplgit/doconce.
From DocOnce one can generate LaTeX, HTML, Sphinx, Markdown, IPython
notebooks, and many other formats. The make.sh gives the details on how
the slides are generated.

To modify the slides, it is recommended to modify the DocOnce source
and run make.sh to make, e.g., beamer slides. (It is possible to
first generate .tex files and then modify and maintain the .tex files.)
